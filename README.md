# Image Fungal Disease Classifier 

The "Fungal Disease Classifier" project aims to develop a solution for analyzing fungal diseases in oilseed leaves. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy and management of these diseases by training a classifier using a custom or self-created dataset.


Fungal diseases can have a significant impact on oilseed crops, leading to reduced yield and quality. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for effective management and prevention of further spread. However, identifying fungal diseases in oilseed leaves can be challenging, as symptoms may vary and overlap with other plant disorders.


To address this challenge, the project focuses on developing a classifier that can accurately identify and classify fungal diseases in oilseed leaves. The classifier will be trained using a dataset specifically created for this purpose. This dataset may include images of healthy leaves as well as leaves affected by various fungal diseases.


By training the classifier on this dataset, the aim is to improve the diagnostic accuracy of fungal disease identification in oilseed leaves. This can help farmers and agricultural professionals make informed decisions regarding disease management strategies, such as targeted treatments or preventive measures.
